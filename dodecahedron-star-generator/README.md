# Dodecahedron Star Generator — a Quin study

An interactive, browser-based tool for building a Bathsheba-Grossman-"Quin"-style
sculpture study: a regular dodecahedron whose 12 pentagonal faces each carry a
swirled, "waving" 5-pointed star, with user-specified ribbon connectors linking
star arms across faces into a single lattice.

Open `index.html` through a local static server (ES modules need `http://`,
not `file://`):

```
cd dodecahedron-star-generator
python3 -m http.server 8080
# then open http://localhost:8080
```

No build step and no CDN dependency — Three.js is vendored under `vendor/three/`.

## The plan

### 1. Base solid: regular dodecahedron

Built as the polar dual of a regular icosahedron (`src/geometry.js:buildDodecahedron`):

- 12 icosahedron vertices → 12 dodecahedron **faces**
- 20 icosahedron faces (their centroids, normalized to the sphere) → 20 dodecahedron **vertices**
- Each dodecahedron face gets a local orthonormal frame `(U, W, N)`: `N` is the
  outward face normal, `U` points at the face's own vertex 0, `W = N × U`. All
  star geometry is authored as flat 2D `(u, w)` coordinates in this frame, then
  mapped to world space — this is the seam where a face could later be swapped
  for a curved/printed patch without touching any of the star math.

Verified numerically: all 12 faces are regular pentagons of equal circumradius,
corners land at exact 72° spacing, and the 20 shared vertices each belong to
exactly 3 faces (correct dodecahedral topology).

### 2. Labeling

- Faces: `F0`–`F11`, labeled at the face center.
- Star arms (the 5 outer tips of each face's star): `F<face>-A0`…`F<face>-A4`,
  in the same counter-clockwise order as the pentagon's own corners (arm `A0`
  always sits at the face's vertex 0).

This `F#-A#` naming is the addressing scheme used everywhere else in the tool:
typed connections, click-to-pick, and status messages all speak it.

### 3. Star shape

Each face gets a classic 10-point pentagram outline: 5 outer tips (the arms,
radius ≈ `R_out`, the pentagon's own circumradius) alternating with 5 inner
concave points (radius `R_out / φ² ≈ 0.382·R_out`, the standard pentagram
ratio). Built in `buildStar()`.

### 4. Swirl (counter-clockwise)

Each point at local radius `r` and angle `θ` is rotated by an amount that
grows with radius:

```
θ' = θ + swirl · (r / R_out)      // swirl in radians, positive = CCW
```

So the star's center stays put while its outline twists more the further out
you go — a simple, controllable "pinwheel" distortion. Exposed as the **Swirl**
slider (0–90°, default 3°).

### 4b. Arm-axis twist (blade twist)

A second, independent rotation layered on top of the in-plane swirl: each
arm's outline points (its tip and the trailing inner point) are rotated about
that specific arm's *own* outward axis — the line from the face center
through that arm's undistorted vertex — by an angle growing with radius,
exactly like the in-plane swirl formula but around a different axis:

```
offset' = offset.applyAxisAngle(armAxis_i, armTwist · (r2 / R_out))
```

Since that axis lies *in* the face plane rather than along the face normal,
rotating around it banks each arm out of the plane as it extends from center
to tip — like a propeller blade twisting along its own length, five
independent blades per star. Exposed as the **Arm-axis twist** slider
(0–90°, default **0°** — off by default; dial it in for a more organic,
less symmetric look).

### 4c. Arm reach and tip curl

Two more knobs aimed specifically at making the arm-to-ribbon transition
read as one continuous curve instead of a rod meeting a star:

- **Arm reach** is just `tipScale` (§3) exposed directly (default **0.8**;
  push it past 1.0 to reach beyond the pentagon's own edge, toward where a
  ribbon needs to go, leaving it less ground to cover).
- **Tip curl** adds extra swirl rotation on top of the base swirl,
  concentrated near the tip: `swirlTheta += curl · (r2/R_out)^1.6`. Default
  **24°**. Combined with arm reach and the earlier-onset tip dip below, the
  arm spends its last stretch already spiraling and sinking toward the
  ribbon's own trajectory, so the ribbon only has to finish a curve already
  in progress rather than execute a sharp U-turn from a standing start.

### 5. Waving (radial distortion)

After swirling, the radius itself is rippled:

```
r' = r2 + (r2 / k) · sin(k · r2)
```

where `r2` is the point's *original*, undistorted distance to the star's
center in the face plane (per the spec — swirl and wave are both independent
functions of `r2`, not of each other's output). `k` controls both the ripple
frequency and (inversely) its amplitude; default `k = 2.7`. Exposed as the
**Wave k** slider, with a checkbox to disable the wave entirely and see the
plain swirled star.

### 6. Curving the faces (forward-looking hook)

The brief notes the flat pentagon faces are stand-ins for eventually-curved
surfaces. Rather than leave that as a TODO, each face point also takes an
optional dome displacement along the face normal:

```
bulge = bulgeStrength · (1 − (r2 / R_out)²)
```

i.e. maximal at the star's center, zero at the pentagon's rim (so neighboring
faces still meet cleanly at shared edges). Default `bulgeStrength = 0.2`.
A true printable/cast curved-surface export is out of scope for this pass.

### 6b. Tip dip (fusing the arm into its ribbon)

A second, independent inward pull — toward the *sphere's* center this time,
not just the face normal:

```
dip = tipDipStrength · (rFinal / R_out)^1.6
world -= normalize(world) · dip
```

`rFinal` is the radius *after* the wave ripple (§5), not the original `r2` -
see the note at the end of this section for why that distinction matters.
The `1.6` exponent (down from an initial `3`, per feedback that the dip was
starting too late and forcing too sharp a turn right at the very end) makes
the pull ramp in gradually well before the tip rather than only in the last
moment, so the arm curls into the sculpture's body over a visible stretch.
Since this lives inside `distortPoint()`, the tip's tangent (used by the
ribbon, see below) is computed *after* this dip (and after arm reach and
curl above) are applied, so the ribbon automatically continues whatever
curve the arm is already tracing — the two read as one continuous surface
rather than a rod stabbed into a star. Exposed as the **Tip dip** slider
(0–0.6, default 0.36).

**Why `rFinal` and not the original `r2`:** bulge (§6) and tip dip are both
now functions of `rFinal = sqrt(u² + w²)`, which is exactly reconstructible
from a bare `(u, w)` pair alone with no other context. That single choice
is what makes the hex-grid fill (§10) - which generates brand-new interior
points directly in `(u, w)` space, with no original `r2` to refer back to -
land in *exactly* the same place `distortPoint()` would, instead of visibly
drifting away from the tube near the edges (verified: 0.0 distance between
the two for every point on a star's own outline).

### 7. Ribbon connectors

Given two arm labels, `src/ribbon.js:buildRibbon()` threads their tip
positions onto a 5-point Catmull-Rom spline: `tip → leave point → dip point →
leave point → tip`. Catmull-Rom passes exactly through every one of those
points (unlike Bézier control points, which only pull the curve without
touching it), which buys two precise guarantees:

- **Continues the arm's own trend, not a reset direction.** Each "leave"
  point sits a short distance along that tip's *actual tangent*
  (`buildStar()` samples the arm's own curve a hair before the tip via
  finite difference, so it captures however swirl/curl/wave/bulge/arm-twist/
  tip-dip are already bending it) rather than the tip's purely-radial
  `outDir`. Combined with the longer arm reach and tip curl/dip above, the
  ribbon picks up a curve that's already underway instead of first shooting
  outward along `outDir` and only then diving inward. (Verified numerically:
  tangent misalignment at the join is under 0.4° across all 60 connections,
  versus a visible kink before this change.)
- **Exact dip depth.** The middle "dip" point is placed at a precise target
  radius from the sculpture's center: `depthFraction × avgRadius`, where
  `avgRadius` is the average of the two tips' own distance from center.
  Default `depthFraction = 0.81` — the ribbon's lowest point sits at 81% of
  the face's radius. (Verified numerically: min/max depth ratio across all
  60 connections exactly matches the configured fraction.) Tunable via the
  **Ribbon depth** slider (50–100%).

The cross-section also blends smoothly: its half-width starts at
`tubeRadius` (matching the star tube's own thickness) right at each tip and
widens to the full ribbon width only in the middle, so there's no jump in
apparent thickness at the join — no more thin thread poking out of a fat
tube. A twisted flat strip is then built along the curve using Frenet frames
plus a continuously increasing twist angle (**Ribbon twist** slider, in full
turns; default **0.5**, a single half-turn — kept low so the strip doesn't
fight itself visually across many simultaneous ribbons).

### 7b. Flattening the star tube into its ribbon (no more rounded cap)

Even with the tangent and width matched at the join (above), the star's own
tube kept a constant *circular* cross-section all the way to the tip, while
the ribbon starts as a *flat* sliver of the same half-width - a shape
mismatch that read as a small rounded cap right where the ribbon should
begin. `src/startube.js:buildStarTube()` replaces the plain
`THREE.TubeGeometry` (which can't vary its cross-section) with a
custom-built tube whose cross-section is circular through the middle of
each arm/inner-point stretch and tapers to a flat, `tubeRadius`-wide sliver
right at each tip:

```
minorAxis(t) = lerp(tubeRadius, tubeRadius · 0.12, tipFlatness(t))
majorAxis(t) = tubeRadius                              // constant - this is the "width" that carries over into the ribbon
```

`tipFlatness(t)` ramps in over the last 5% of curve-parameter distance to
each of the 5 tip points (mirroring the ribbon's own tapering zone), using
the tube's own Frenet frame (normal = major/width axis, binormal =
minor/thickness axis that shrinks). The minor axis never fully collapses to
zero, which would produce degenerate normals right at the tip - it shrinks
to 12% of `tubeRadius` instead, reading as flat without a shading glitch.
(Verified numerically: cross-section at a tip has minor/major axis ratio of
exactly 0.12, vs. a perfect circle - ratio 1.0 - one full arm-length away.)

### 8. Specifying connections

The **Manual ribbon connections** box accepts free-form text — the parser
simply scans for `F<n>-A<n>` tokens (any separator: `:`, `->`, commas,
newlines, whitespace) and pairs them up in order, e.g.:

```
F0-A2:F5-A1, F2-A3:F9-A0
F1-A0 -> F7-A3
```

Invalid tokens (bad face/arm index) or a trailing unmatched arm are reported
in the status line instead of silently dropped. As a faster alternative to
typing, **click any two arm markers in the 3D view** — the markers
themselves are invisible by default (a visible dot at every tip read as a
small stub breaking the fused arm/ribbon look), but the geometry is still
there for raycasting: the first click lights its marker up red as feedback,
and the second click appends `A:B` to the text box, redraws, and clears the
highlight.

### 9. Adjacent-face connections (always on)

`src/geometry.js:computeAdjacentFaceConnections()` generates the sculpture's
"neighbor" ribbons from a single combinatorial rule, reverse-engineered from
two reference sets: 5 connections onto face 7, then 5 more onto face 1 to
pin down how it generalizes:

```
F6-A0:F7-A2, F10-A1:F7-A3, F7-A4:F0-A3, F7-A0:F1-A3, F8-A0:F7-A1
F1-A0:F9-A2, F1-A1:F8-A1, F1-A2:F7-A1, F1-A3:F0-A2, F1-A4:F5-A2
```

**The rule.** For face `F` and arm `m`, take the edge of `F` between its
vertices `(m+1)` and `(m+2)` (mod 5). That edge is shared with exactly one
neighbor face `G`. `F`'s arm `m` connects to `G`'s arm at that shared
`(m+2)` vertex (`ruleForArm()`).

**Applied identically to every face.** All 5 of the given face-7 pairs are
exactly face 7's own 5 rule outputs, and all 5 of the given face-1 pairs are
exactly face 1's own 5 rule outputs (verified) — i.e. every face gets to
keep its own 5 edges, with no exceptions or priority between faces. Running
that same, single, unmodified rule across all 12 faces × 5 arms produces
**60 edges total**. An earlier version of this tool tried to reduce that to
one edge per arm (a strict matching), but that reduction is what produced
mismatches against the face-1 reference (e.g. it dropped `F1-A2:F7-A1` in
favor of `F7-A1:F8-A0`, since both can't hold if each arm is limited to one
connection) — the two reference sets are only *simultaneously* satisfiable
by keeping every face's full 5-edge output, unreduced.

**Result:** since an arm can be both the "m" source of its own face's rule
and the landing target of a neighboring face's rule, every one of the 60
arms ends up touched by **exactly two** ribbons — "every arm connected," as
intended, with identical logic run once per face. This is always on;
there's no toggle for it. Manual connections from the text box are merged
in (de-duplicated) on top of this fixed set.

### 10. Filling the star interior: solid membrane or hex grid

Two mutually-exclusive checkboxes (checking one unchecks the other):

- **Fill star interior (thin surface)** triangulates each star's 10-point
  outline (`THREE.ShapeUtils.triangulateShape` on the same local 2D `(u, w)`
  coordinates used to place the outline, via `src/membrane.js`) into a thin
  double-sided panel.
- **Fill star interior (hex grid)** (`src/hexgrid.js`) tiles a pointy-top
  hexagonal grid across the same local 2D coordinates, clips each hex edge
  against the star's (concave) outline using a generic segment/polygon
  clip - not just an inside/outside test, so partial cells along the
  boundary are cut cleanly rather than dropped or left overhanging - and
  turns every surviving strut into a thin quad in 3D via the shared
  `applyTipDip()` (§6b) plus the same bulge formula, so it follows the
  star's *actual* surface, not an approximation of it. Cell size is tunable
  via the **Hex cell size** slider (default 0.02 - a fine lattice).

The solid membrane is trivially exact (it's built entirely from the star's
own already-computed outline points, no new ones). The hex grid needed more
care since it generates brand-new interior points directly in `(u, w)`
space with no original `r2` to place them from - see the `rFinal` note in
§6b for how that's kept exact rather than approximate.

### 11. Materials

Two `MeshStandardMaterial` instances - one for the stars/membranes, one for
ribbons - are kept in sync on color/metalness/roughness (so the piece reads
as one cast/printed material, not mixed parts) and switchable from the
**Material** dropdown:

- **Bronze** — warm gold, metalness 0.75, roughness 0.32 (the original look)
- **Titanium** — cool grey, metalness 0.9, roughness 0.45 (brushed, not mirror-like)
- **Metallized (chrome)** — near-white, metalness 1.0, roughness 0.08

A generated `RoomEnvironment` (via `THREE.PMREMGenerator`, no external HDRI
needed) is set as `scene.environment` so the metallic presets — especially
the near-mirror chrome one — actually show reflections instead of reading
flat and dark.

The ribbon material additionally carries a hex-pattern bump/roughness map
(`src/hextexture.js:createHexTexture()`) — a small canvas of hexagon
outlines, sized so it tiles seamlessly (`THREE.RepeatWrapping`) — so the
ribbon reads as "the same texture" as the star's own 3D hex-grid fill (§10),
just applied as a relief pattern rather than literal geometry (a ribbon
twists too much along its length for tiling actual 3D hex struts onto it to
be practical). `buildRibbon()` writes UV coordinates from actual arc length
(via `curve.getLength()`), and the tiling density is matched to the real
world-space hex-grid cell size (`sqrt(3) × R_out × hexCellFraction`) so the
two don't just share a pattern but the same apparent scale.

### 12. Collapsing the control panel

The chevron button in the panel's corner toggles a `.collapsed` class on
the panel, hiding everything below the title/subtitle. Pure CSS/JS, no
persistence across reloads.

## Verified

- Geometry math checked standalone under Node (`buildDodecahedron`/`buildStar`):
  12 equal-circumradius pentagon faces, exact 72° corner spacing, 20 vertices
  each shared by exactly 3 faces.
- `computeAdjacentFaceConnections()` checked standalone under Node: produces
  exactly 60 pairs, all 5 face-7 reference pairs present, all 5 face-1
  reference pairs present, every one of the 60 arms touched, and degree
  exactly 2 (min = max = 2) for all of them.
- `buildRibbon()` checked standalone under Node across all 60 connection
  pairs with the new defaults: depth ratio (min radius along the curve ÷
  average endpoint radius) exactly matches the configured `depthFraction` in
  every case, and worst-case tangent misalignment between the curve's
  initial tangent and the tip's own arm-tangent is 0.40°.
- The hex-grid continuity fix checked standalone under Node: replicating
  `buildHexGrid()`'s point-placement formula and comparing it against every
  point on a star's own outline gives a max distance of `0.00000000` -
  exact, not approximate (this is what the `rFinal`-instead-of-`r2` change
  in §6b buys).
- `buildStarTube()` checked standalone under Node: 1600 vertices / 9600
  indices for the default 200×8 resolution, no NaNs, and the cross-section
  at a tip parameter has minor/major axis ratio 0.12 vs. 1.0 (a full circle)
  one arm-length away - the taper is real, not cosmetic.
- Star outline triangulation (`buildMembrane`) and hex-grid clipping
  (`buildHexGrid`) checked standalone: expected triangle counts, no NaNs.
- Full app checked in headless Chromium: renders with zero console errors
  against every default in this pass; the collapse chevron hides/shows the
  panel; the hex bump texture is visible on ribbon surfaces at close range
  and reads at the same scale as the star's own hex-grid fill; the round
  tube visibly narrows into flat ribbon width approaching each tip instead
  of ending in a rounded cap.

## Possible next steps

- Export the lattice (stars + ribbons) as a single manifold mesh (STL/OBJ) for
  3D printing or CNC.
- Replace the flat-face + bulge approximation with a true curved parametric
  surface per face for a printable Quin-accurate shell.
- Per-face swirl/k overrides (currently global) for asymmetric compositions.
