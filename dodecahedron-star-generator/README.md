# Dodecahedron Star Generator — a Quin study

An interactive, browser-based tool for building a Bathsheba-Grossman-"Quin"-style
sculpture study: a regular dodecahedron whose 12 pentagonal faces each carry a
swirled, "waving" 5-pointed star, with user-specified ribbon connectors linking
star arms across faces into a single lattice.

Open `index.html` through a local static server (ES modules need `http://`,
not `file://`):

```
cd dodecahedron-star-generator
python3 -m http.server 8080
# then open http://localhost:8080
```

No build step and no CDN dependency — Three.js is vendored under `vendor/three/`.

## The plan

### 1. Base solid: regular dodecahedron

Built as the polar dual of a regular icosahedron (`src/geometry.js:buildDodecahedron`):

- 12 icosahedron vertices → 12 dodecahedron **faces**
- 20 icosahedron faces (their centroids, normalized to the sphere) → 20 dodecahedron **vertices**
- Each dodecahedron face gets a local orthonormal frame `(U, W, N)`: `N` is the
  outward face normal, `U` points at the face's own vertex 0, `W = N × U`. All
  star geometry is authored as flat 2D `(u, w)` coordinates in this frame, then
  mapped to world space — this is the seam where a face could later be swapped
  for a curved/printed patch without touching any of the star math.

Verified numerically: all 12 faces are regular pentagons of equal circumradius,
corners land at exact 72° spacing, and the 20 shared vertices each belong to
exactly 3 faces (correct dodecahedral topology).

### 2. Labeling

- Faces: `F0`–`F11`, labeled at the face center.
- Star arms (the 5 outer tips of each face's star): `F<face>-A0`…`F<face>-A4`,
  in the same counter-clockwise order as the pentagon's own corners (arm `A0`
  always sits at the face's vertex 0).

This `F#-A#` naming is the addressing scheme used everywhere else in the tool:
typed connections, click-to-pick, and status messages all speak it.

### 3. Star shape

Each face gets a classic 10-point pentagram outline: 5 outer tips (the arms,
radius ≈ `R_out`, the pentagon's own circumradius) alternating with 5 inner
concave points (radius `R_out / φ² ≈ 0.382·R_out`, the standard pentagram
ratio). Built in `buildStar()`.

### 4. Swirl (counter-clockwise)

Each point at local radius `r` and angle `θ` is rotated by an amount that
grows with radius:

```
θ' = θ + swirl · (r / R_out)      // swirl in radians, positive = CCW
```

So the star's center stays put while its outline twists more the further out
you go — a simple, controllable "pinwheel" distortion. Exposed as the **Swirl**
slider (0–90°, default 23°).

### 4b. Arm-axis twist (blade twist)

A second, independent rotation layered on top of the in-plane swirl: each
arm's outline points (its tip and the trailing inner point) are rotated about
that specific arm's *own* outward axis — the line from the face center
through that arm's undistorted vertex — by an angle growing with radius,
exactly like the in-plane swirl formula but around a different axis:

```
offset' = offset.applyAxisAngle(armAxis_i, armTwist · (r2 / R_out))
```

Since that axis lies *in* the face plane rather than along the face normal,
rotating around it banks each arm out of the plane as it extends from center
to tip — like a propeller blade twisting along its own length, five
independent blades per star. Exposed as the **Arm-axis twist** slider
(0–90°, default **0°** — off by default; dial it in for a more organic,
less symmetric look).

### 5. Waving (radial distortion)

After swirling, the radius itself is rippled:

```
r' = r2 + (r2 / k) · sin(k · r2)
```

where `r2` is the point's *original*, undistorted distance to the star's
center in the face plane (per the spec — swirl and wave are both independent
functions of `r2`, not of each other's output). `k` controls both the ripple
frequency and (inversely) its amplitude; default `k = 5`. Exposed as the
**Wave k** slider, with a checkbox to disable the wave entirely and see the
plain swirled star.

### 6. Curving the faces (forward-looking hook)

The brief notes the flat pentagon faces are stand-ins for eventually-curved
surfaces. Rather than leave that as a TODO, each face point also takes an
optional dome displacement along the face normal:

```
bulge = bulgeStrength · (1 − (r2 / R_out)²)
```

i.e. maximal at the star's center, zero at the pentagon's rim (so neighboring
faces still meet cleanly at shared edges). Default `bulgeStrength = 0.5`.
A true printable/cast curved-surface export is out of scope for this pass.

### 6b. Tip dip (fusing the arm into its ribbon)

A second, independent inward pull — toward the *sphere's* center this time,
not just the face normal — concentrated sharply at the tip via a cubic
falloff:

```
dip = tipDipStrength · (r2 / R_out)³
world -= normalize(world) · dip
```

Because the falloff is cubic, it's negligible through most of the arm and
only kicks in right at the end, so the arm visibly curls into the
sculpture's body just before it stops — instead of ending flat and then
having a separate ribbon merely touch that endpoint. Since this lives inside
`distortPoint()`, the tip's tangent (used by the ribbon, see below) is
computed *after* this dip is applied, so the ribbon automatically continues
whatever curl the arm is already doing — the two read as one continuous
surface rather than a rod stabbed into a star. Exposed as the **Tip dip**
slider (0–0.6, default 0.2; try 0.5 to see the effect exaggerated).

### 7. Ribbon connectors

Given two arm labels, `src/ribbon.js:buildRibbon()` threads their tip
positions onto a 5-point Catmull-Rom spline: `tip → leave point → dip point →
leave point → tip`. Catmull-Rom passes exactly through every one of those
points (unlike Bézier control points, which only pull the curve without
touching it), which buys two precise guarantees:

- **Continues the arm's own trend, not a reset direction.** Each "leave"
  point sits a short distance along that tip's *actual tangent*
  (`buildStar()` samples the arm's own curve a hair before the tip via
  finite difference, so it captures however swirl/wave/bulge/arm-twist/tip-dip
  are already bending it) rather than the tip's purely-radial `outDir`.
  Combined with the tip-dip curl above, the ribbon picks up a curve that's
  already underway instead of first shooting outward along `outDir` and
  only then diving inward. (Verified numerically: tangent misalignment at
  the join is under 0.4° across all 60 connections, versus a visible kink
  before this change.)
- **Exact dip depth.** The middle "dip" point is placed at a precise target
  radius from the sculpture's center: `depthFraction × avgRadius`, where
  `avgRadius` is the average of the two tips' own distance from center.
  Default `depthFraction = 0.8` — the ribbon's lowest point sits at 80% of
  the face's radius. (Verified numerically: min/max depth ratio across all
  60 connections is exactly 0.800.) Tunable via the **Ribbon depth** slider
  (50–100%).

The cross-section also blends smoothly: its half-width starts at
`tubeRadius` (matching the star tube's own thickness) right at each tip and
widens to the full ribbon width only in the middle, so there's no jump in
apparent thickness at the join — no more thin thread poking out of a fat
tube. A twisted flat strip is then built along the curve using Frenet frames
plus a continuously increasing twist angle (**Ribbon twist** slider, in full
turns; default **0.5**, a single half-turn — kept low so the strip doesn't
fight itself visually across many simultaneous ribbons).

### 8. Specifying connections

The **Manual ribbon connections** box accepts free-form text — the parser
simply scans for `F<n>-A<n>` tokens (any separator: `:`, `->`, commas,
newlines, whitespace) and pairs them up in order, e.g.:

```
F0-A2:F5-A1, F2-A3:F9-A0
F1-A0 -> F7-A3
```

Invalid tokens (bad face/arm index) or a trailing unmatched arm are reported
in the status line instead of silently dropped. As a faster alternative to
typing, **click any two arm markers in the 3D view** — the first click is
highlighted red and the second one appends `A:B` to the text box and redraws
automatically.

### 9. Adjacent-face connections (always on)

`src/geometry.js:computeAdjacentFaceConnections()` generates the sculpture's
"neighbor" ribbons from a single combinatorial rule, reverse-engineered from
two reference sets: 5 connections onto face 7, then 5 more onto face 1 to
pin down how it generalizes:

```
F6-A0:F7-A2, F10-A1:F7-A3, F7-A4:F0-A3, F7-A0:F1-A3, F8-A0:F7-A1
F1-A0:F9-A2, F1-A1:F8-A1, F1-A2:F7-A1, F1-A3:F0-A2, F1-A4:F5-A2
```

**The rule.** For face `F` and arm `m`, take the edge of `F` between its
vertices `(m+1)` and `(m+2)` (mod 5). That edge is shared with exactly one
neighbor face `G`. `F`'s arm `m` connects to `G`'s arm at that shared
`(m+2)` vertex (`ruleForArm()`).

**Applied identically to every face.** All 5 of the given face-7 pairs are
exactly face 7's own 5 rule outputs, and all 5 of the given face-1 pairs are
exactly face 1's own 5 rule outputs (verified) — i.e. every face gets to
keep its own 5 edges, with no exceptions or priority between faces. Running
that same, single, unmodified rule across all 12 faces × 5 arms produces
**60 edges total**. An earlier version of this tool tried to reduce that to
one edge per arm (a strict matching), but that reduction is what produced
mismatches against the face-1 reference (e.g. it dropped `F1-A2:F7-A1` in
favor of `F7-A1:F8-A0`, since both can't hold if each arm is limited to one
connection) — the two reference sets are only *simultaneously* satisfiable
by keeping every face's full 5-edge output, unreduced.

**Result:** since an arm can be both the "m" source of its own face's rule
and the landing target of a neighboring face's rule, every one of the 60
arms ends up touched by **exactly two** ribbons — "every arm connected," as
intended, with identical logic run once per face. This is always on;
there's no toggle for it. Manual connections from the text box are merged
in (de-duplicated) on top of this fixed set.

### 10. Filling the star interior: solid membrane or hex grid

Two mutually-exclusive checkboxes (checking one unchecks the other):

- **Fill star interior (thin surface)** triangulates each star's 10-point
  outline (`THREE.ShapeUtils.triangulateShape` on the same local 2D `(u, w)`
  coordinates used to place the outline, via `src/membrane.js`) into a thin
  double-sided panel.
- **Fill star interior (hex grid)** (`src/hexgrid.js`) tiles a pointy-top
  hexagonal grid across the same local 2D coordinates, clips each hex edge
  against the star's (concave) outline using a generic segment/polygon
  clip - not just an inside/outside test, so partial cells along the
  boundary are cut cleanly rather than dropped or left overhanging - and
  turns every surviving strut into a thin quad in 3D, following the star's
  own bulge-along-normal profile. Cell size is tunable via the **Hex cell
  size** slider.

Both modes are built from the exact same (already swirled/waved/twisted/
bulged) points the tube is drawn through, so their boundary sits flush
against the inside of the tube with no seam.

### 11. Materials

A single `MeshStandardMaterial` is shared across the stars, ribbons, and
membranes (so the piece reads as one cast/printed material, not mixed
parts), switchable from the **Material** dropdown:

- **Bronze** — warm gold, metalness 0.75, roughness 0.32 (the original look)
- **Titanium** — cool grey, metalness 0.9, roughness 0.45 (brushed, not mirror-like)
- **Metallized (chrome)** — near-white, metalness 1.0, roughness 0.08

A generated `RoomEnvironment` (via `THREE.PMREMGenerator`, no external HDRI
needed) is set as `scene.environment` so the metallic presets — especially
the near-mirror chrome one — actually show reflections instead of reading
flat and dark.

## Verified

- Geometry math checked standalone under Node (`buildDodecahedron`/`buildStar`):
  12 equal-circumradius pentagon faces, exact 72° corner spacing, 20 vertices
  each shared by exactly 3 faces.
- `computeAdjacentFaceConnections()` checked standalone under Node: produces
  exactly 60 pairs, all 5 face-7 reference pairs present, all 5 face-1
  reference pairs present, every one of the 60 arms touched, and degree
  exactly 2 (min = max = 2) for all of them.
- `buildRibbon()` checked standalone under Node across all 60 connection
  pairs with the new defaults (including `tipDipStrength = 0.2`): depth
  ratio (min radius along the curve ÷ average endpoint radius) is exactly
  0.800 in every case, and worst-case tangent misalignment between the
  curve's initial tangent and the tip's own arm-tangent is 0.40°.
- Star outline triangulation (`buildMembrane`) and hex-grid clipping
  (`buildHexGrid`) checked standalone: expected triangle counts, no NaNs.
- Full app checked in headless Chromium: renders with zero console errors;
  every slider (swirl/arm-twist/k/bulge/tip dip/tube radius/twist/ribbon
  depth/hex cell size) and toggle (membrane, hex grid, material) visibly
  does what it says, including mutual exclusion between the two fill modes,
  the tip-dip curl visibly deepening at higher values, the fine 0.02-default
  hex grid rendering cleanly, and chrome/titanium reflections from the
  generated environment.

## Possible next steps

- Export the lattice (stars + ribbons) as a single manifold mesh (STL/OBJ) for
  3D printing or CNC.
- Replace the flat-face + bulge approximation with a true curved parametric
  surface per face for a printable Quin-accurate shell.
- Per-face swirl/k overrides (currently global) for asymmetric compositions.
